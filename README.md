# Mental Health & Social Media — Logistic Regression Shiny App

This repository contains an interactive **R Shiny application** that analyzes the relationship between social media habits and mental well-being using logistic regression. The project is part of **DS501 – Case Study 3**, focusing on the data science lifecycle, machine learning modeling, and building an interactive web application.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the:

**Mental Health Social Media Balance Dataset**  
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets  

(Direct link if needed: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintan/mental-health-social-media-balance-dataset)

This dataset includes variables such as:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Daily Screen Time  
- Sleep Quality  
- Stress Level  
- Days Without Social Media  
- Exercise Frequency  
- Social Media Platform  
- Happiness Index  

The goal of the dataset is to explore the relationship between online behavior, lifestyle habits, and overall happiness.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to:

1. **Load and clean the dataset**  
2. **Create a binary mental health outcome**  
   - `Low_Happiness = 1` if Happiness ≤ 5  
   - `Low_Happiness = 0` otherwise  
3. **Build a Logistic Regression model** to predict the likelihood of low happiness based on social media behavior and lifestyle factors  
4. **Develop an interactive Shiny App** where users can:  
   - View model summary  
   - Adjust the classification threshold  
   - View a confusion matrix and performance metrics  
   - Input hypothetical user characteristics to generate predictions  
5. **Deploy the app online** via shinyapps.io  

This project demonstrates the complete **data science lifecycle**:  
data ingestion → cleaning → modeling → evaluation → communication.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The app implements a **Logistic Regression** model trained with:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Daily Screen Time  
- Sleep Quality  
- Stress Level  
- Days Without Social Media  
- Exercise Frequency  
- Social Media Platform  

The model predicts the probability that a person has **Low Happiness (≤ 5)**.
